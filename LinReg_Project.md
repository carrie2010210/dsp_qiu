# Movie Box Office Analysis and Prediction using Linear Regression

Linear Regression can be considered as the first pass in both exploratory and predictive modeling in that it is easy to interpret and provides valuable insights (if EDA is thoroughly performed). 
The motivation behind this project is to present a business case where linear regression can be used to predict revenue.

### Motivation 
A client for this project could be any stakeholder in the film industry, like movie producers, investment firms, or directors. 
Some interesting questions that can be explored includes:
* How does Domestic Grossing compare to Foreign Grossing by feature?
* Does seasonal release influence box office returns?
* What are the most important features contributing to box office returns?

This is a good exercise for Linear Regression because there are some very logical assumptions we can make about the linear relationship between independent and dependent variables. 
With these linear regression assumptions in mind, the modeling can begin.
