# Welcome to my Project Repository

Here is a selection of project I have completed during the course of Metis Datascience bootcamp Spring 2019 in New York City. Metis is an ACCET-accredited 12-week immersive data science bootcamp focused on developing working knowledge of Machine Learning, Statistical Modeling, Programming in Python, and Data Analysis and Visualization.

Project Summary:

[Songwriter's Sketchpad](https://github.com/carrie2010210/dsp_qiu/blob/master/Songwriter's%20Sketchpad.ipynb): Multi-featured application to help songwriters in their creative process. This project is done using Convolution Neural Network in the form of an Autoencoder, and cosine similarity for recommendation engine. For the Natural Language Processing portion for Lyrics Analyzer, please view [Songwriter's Sketchpad: Lyrics](link).
